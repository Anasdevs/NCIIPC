        The <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Ministry of Education's Innovation Cell</span> conducts the annual Smart India Hackathon where it crowdsources the problems/challenges from different organisations and ministries in the form of hackathon challenges and opens it up for all the colleges and universities in the country.

      <p className="mb-4">
        In 2023, <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">NTRO</span> decided to participate in this hackathon and multiple centres took an initiative to come up with unique problem statements for the challenge.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        12 Problem statements were announced in the Smart India Hackathon 2023 which attracted 1207 entries in the first stage.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The event witnessed a major participation from NTRO. Nominated personnel participated in the mentorship and evaluation exercises which allowed an intensive engagement with over 300 shortlisted young and innovative minds- guiding the team thinking and solution to align with the real world requirements.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Given the range and depth of talent spotted and the opportunity cost of our personnel having interacted with them over two days, it was decided to use this forum as an opportunity to announce a special internship drive. Interns are undertaking internships primarily focused on developing further some of the solutions they had developed for the SIH finals. During the internship they will also be offered additional work in line with their skillsets.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        NTRO's unique problem statements, mentorship and internship opportunity has caught the attention and interest of many young students around the country promising to improve response to collaborate in future endeavors.
